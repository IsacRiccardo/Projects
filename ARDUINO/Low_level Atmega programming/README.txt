*PROJECT DESCCRIPTION*

-> In this project the goal was to understand how to program the ATmega328 microcontroller without using premade functions.

-> To achieve different functionalities we used registers programming together with interruptions, timers and the built-in CAN

-> The study of the microcontroller datasheet was mandatory!!
