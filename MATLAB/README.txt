*Description*

This is a project focused on finding out the efficiency of a Rapid Fourier Transform filter when using different noises with a constant ratio between the original signal amplitude and the noise amplitude. 

The project was done in romanian and translated with Google translate, so i'm sorry if the english is bad in the docx document.

In the Matlab files/ directory we have the main files used for this project. (I don't want to put all of it because of personal reasons).
